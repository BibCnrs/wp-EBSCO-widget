## 1.5.0 improved warnings
  - try to specify which Immutable data structure was provided instead of saying `object`.
## 1.4.0 added support for orderedSetOf and orderedMapOf
## 1.3.0 added support for record and recordOf type checkers.

## 1.2.x
- 1.2.3 [Nik Butenko](http://butenko.me/) provided a better .npmignore file
  - allows devs who want to compile the code to do so
  - better excludes files that are not needed for distribution
- 1.2.2 [Nik Butenko](http://butenko.me/) gave us some nice updates ()
  - [Issue #10](https://github.com/HurricaneJames/react-immutable-proptypes/pull/10) now have better errors when typechecker(s) provided in `propTypes` definition is invalid
  - [Issue #9](https://github.com/HurricaneJames/react-immutable-proptypes/pull/9) removed use of `new` Immutable objects in tests
- 1.2.1 updated documentation to reflect that Immutable object instantiation does not require `new`
- 1.2.0 moved react from peer dependency to dev dependency since React is only used internally to test. This will allow the prop type validators to work on beta/rc versions of react.
